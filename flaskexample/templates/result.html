<h1>Thanks for using Doctor Lung!</h1>
<h3>Following is your sound spectrogram</h3>
<div><img src={{wavepng_filename}} width="600"></div>


<p>The total length of uploaded sound is {{audio_length}} seconds.</p>
<p>There are <b>{{n_wheezes}}</b> wheezes and <b>{{n_crackles}}</b> crackles predicted in your sound.</p>

<p>You could refer to the following histogram to see where your situation<b>(red line)</b> is located among other 86 patients. Your number of wheezes is better than <b>{{wheezes_percentile}}%</b> patients. Your number of crackles is better than <b>{{crackles_percentile}}%</b> patients. Based on both wheezes and crackles detected in your sound, you are better than <b>{{together_percentile}}%</b> patients. </p>
